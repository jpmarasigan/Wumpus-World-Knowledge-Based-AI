# Knowledge-Based AI Agent in Wumpus World Game

## Introduction
In the Wumpus World Game, the player controls an agent navigating through grid-based environment (N x N), where N is the size of the grid. The objective is to explore the world, avoid dangers such as pits and the wumpus (a monster), find gold or kill wumpus. Agent rely on its sense (perceptions) to gather information about adjacent squares.

To maximize the chances of survival and success, this project integrates a Knowledge-Based AI using Rule of Inferences to gather perceptions and create decision making, where agent moves depends on the perception created from inferences.
